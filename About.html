            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>
                Welcome to Dawson's Car Dealership - the ultimate destination for automobile enthusiasts with a taste for the exquisite and the powerful. Our journey into the world of rare and sports cars began with a single wrench, a set of skilled hands, and a passion for transforming the ordinary into the extraordinary.
            </p>

            <h1>The Founder</h1>

            

            <p>
                Dawson Mercier, our esteemed founder, isn't just a name behind a brand; he's the very heartbeat of this establishment. With grease on his hands and determination in his soul, Dawson embarked on his automotive journey in 2003 as a car mechanic. His exceptional skill and relentless pursuit of perfection quickly set him apart in the world of automotive repair.

                But Dawson's ambitions revolved around not just fixing cars, but reviving them. In 2013, he shifted gears to focus on restoring and selling used rare cars. Dawson's touch brought back the lost glory of classic beauties that once roared on the highways and racetracks, and his small garage became a haven for rare finds.
